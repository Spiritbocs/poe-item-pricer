## Adding New Images

When adding new item images:

1. Name the file using kebab-case (e.g., `kaoms-heart.png` not `KaomsHeart.png`)
2. Place it in the appropriate subdirectory based on item type
3. Ensure the image is of reasonable size and quality
4. Update the item data in the API to reference the new image path
